       # Or:

             interval => $seconds,

             on_fetch => sub {
                my ($feed_reader, $new_entries, $feed, $error) = @_;

                if (defined $error) {
                   warn "ERROR: $error\n";
                   return;
                }

                # see above
             }
          );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements some glue between AnyEvent::HTTP and XML::Feed.
    It can fetch a RSS/Atom feed on a regular interval as well as on
    customized times. It also keeps track of already fetched entries so that
    you will only get the new entries.

METHODS
    $feed_reader = AnyEvent::Feed->new (url => $url, %args)
        This is the constructor for a new feed reader for the RSS/Atom feed
        reachable by the URL $url. %args may contain additional key/value
        pairs:

        interval => $seconds
            If this is set you also have to specify the "on_fetch" callback
            (see below). It will try to fetch the $url every $seconds
            seconds and call the callback given by "on_fetch" with the
            result.

        headers => $http_hdrs
            Additional HTTP headers for each GET request can be passed in
            the $http_hdrs hash reference, just like you would pass it to
            the "headers" argument of the "http_get" request of
            AnyEvent::HTTP.

        username => $http_user
        password => $http_pass
            These are the HTTP username and password that will be used for
            Basic HTTP Authentication with the HTTP server when fetching the
            feed. This is mostly sugar for you so you don't have to encode
            them yourself and pass them to the "headers" argument above.

        on_fetch => $cb->($feed_reader, $new_entries, $feed_obj, $error)
            This callback is called if the "interval" parameter is given
            (see above) with the same arguments as the callback given to the
            "fetch" method (see below).

        entry_ages => $hash
            This will set the hash which keeps track of seen and old
            entries. See also the documentation of the "entry_ages" method
            below. The default will be an empty hash reference.

        max_entry_age => $count
            This will set the maximum number of times an entry is kept in
            the "entry_ages" hash after it has not been seen in the feed
            anymore. The default value is 2 which means that an entry hash
            is removed from the "entry_ages" hash after it has not been seen
            in the feed for 2 fetches.

    $feed_reader->url
        Just returns the url that this feed reader is fetching from.

    $feed_reader->entry_ages ($new_entry_ages)
    my $entry_ages = $feed_reader->entry_ages
        This will set the age hash which will keep track of already seen
        entries. The keys of the hash will be the calculated hashes of the
        entries and the values will be a counter of how often they have NOT
        been seen anymore (kind of an age counter). After each fetch this
        hash is updated and seen entries get a value of 0.

    $feed_reader->fetch ($cb->($feed_reader, $new_entries, $feed_obj,
    $error))
        This will initiate a HTTP GET on the URL passed to "new" and call
        $cb when done.

        $feed_reader is the feed reader object itself. $new_entries is an
        array reference containing the new entries. A new entry in that
        array is another array containing a calculated hash over the
        contents of the new entry, and the XML::Feed::Entry object of that
        entry. $feed_obj is the XML::Feed feed object used to parse the
        fetched feed and contains all entries (and not just the 'new' ones).

        What a 'new' entry is, is decided by a map of hashes as described in
        the "entry_ages" method's documentation above.

BUGS
  Known Bugs
    There is actually a known bug with encodings of contents of Atom feeds.
    XML::Atom by default gives you UTF-8 encoded data. You have to set this
    global variable to be able to use the XML::Feed::Entry interface without
    knowledge of the underlying feed type:

       $XML::Atom::ForceUnicode = 1;

    I've re-reported this bug against XML::Feed, as I think it should take
    care of this. XML::Atom should probably just fix it's Unicode interface,
    but it seems to be a bit deserted w.r.t. fixing the bugs in the tracker.

    be notified and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
    your bug as I make changes.
